<h1>The Blue Rebellion</h1>
<h2>By the end of eighteenth century demands of indigo increased. The rytos(farmers) were reluctant to grow indigo as they were forced to sign a contract, and agreement(satta). Those who find the contract got cash advances the planters at low rates. The planters provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivator prepared the soil, sowed the seeds and looked after the crops.When the harvest of indigo was delivered to the planter a new loan was give to the ryot, and the cycles started all over a game.
Peasants who were usually tempted by the loans soon realised that the price they got for the indigo they produced was very low and the cycle level ended.
