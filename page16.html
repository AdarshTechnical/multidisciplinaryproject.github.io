<h1>Anglo-Mysore war</h1>
<h2>The Angloâ€“Mysore Wars were a series of wars fought during the last three decades of the 18th century between the Kingdom of Mysore on the one hand, and the British East India Company, and the Nizam of Hyderabad on the other. Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan fought a war on four fronts with the British attacking from the west, south and east, while the Nizam's forces attacked from the north.The fourth war resulted in the overthrow of the house of Hyder Ali and Tipu (who was killed in the fourth war, in 1799), and the dismantlement of Mysore to the benefit of the East India Company, which took control of much of the Indian subcontinent.
