<h1>The Sepoys Disagreement</h1>
<h2>The Indian sepoys in the employ of the Company also had reasons for discontent. They were unhappy about their pay, allowances and conditions of service.Some of the new rules, moreover, violated their religious sensibilities and beliefs. In those days </h2><h2>many people in the country believed that if they crossed the sea they would lose their religion and caste.
In 1824 the sepoys were told to go to Burma by the sea route to fight for the Company, they refused to follow the order, though they agreed to go by the land route. They were severely punished, and since the issue did not die down, in 1856 the Company passed a new law which stated that every new person who took up employment in the Companyâ€™s army had to agree to serve overseas if required.
